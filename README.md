# Liz Makes a Calendar App

##Discription
This is a calendar app where daily work can be scheduled. It features a clock that displays the current date and time as wel as color-coded time blocks that change dynamically according to the time of day.

This project gave me practice working with 3rd party APIs like jQuiry and Bootstrap.
